# Hyperion Text Editor<br /> [ Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion is a text editor based on GTK widget toolkit. It's handy, rapid and easy to install.

## Building Hyperion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, since the Hyperion is built on Gtk4 toolkit you need to install Gtk4 on your system. It's available on all popular platforms. You can download it from [the official GTK page.](https://www.gtk.org/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Gtk4 is now installed, clone this repository to your local machine and :
```
$> git clone https://github.com/wiseStann/HyperionTextEditor.git
$> cd HyperionTextEditor
```

```
$> chmod 777 setup.sh
$> chmod 777 meson_compile.sh
```

```
$> ./bin/Hyperion
```
